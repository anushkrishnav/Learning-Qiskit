# Classical Probability
(Note: for Source and reference click [here](https://github.com/anushkrishnav/Learning-Qiskit/new/main#source)  )
## Intro
* Quantum phenomena and probabilities are related 
* classical means pre-quantum
## Probability Trees
* A map of all possible eventuality to calculate the chance of happening. <br>

* We can use probability tree model to correctly predict the result of our experiments
* going furthur we can chain our trees together to predict the outcomes of chain of events

## Qubit or The Quantum Coin
* They are very difficult to manipulate and can be done so only in labs
* we can ignore the physical complications and just remember that when we measure a qubit, it will be in one of two states: Instead of the two states Heads and Tails, we call our qubitâ€™s two states 0 and 1
## Quantum Toss
* Lets consider a Quantum coin toss and atempt to map it
* Remb the unlike normal coin A quantum coin has 2 states<br>
<pre>
    |--1/2---> 0 
0---|
    |---1/2--> 1

    |--1/2---> 0

    |---1/2--> 1

* Tossing 2 coins

* This doesn't match our prediction at all! Our model has failed us!
